## Reference

For a full API reference, you can visit [our docs](https://sdk-doc-liquid.breez.technology/). 
Furthermore, I suggest you also check out our [Python example](https://github.com/breez/breez-sdk-liquid-docs/blob/main/examples/python/cli/cli.py) as a more practical reference.

You can find the solution to each step under the branch [solutions](https://github.com/hydra-yse/liquid-sdk-demo/tree/solutions).
To avoid "spoiling", I suggest you checkout each solution one-by-one. You can do so by running:
```bash
git checkout s1 # Checks out at solution 1
git checkout s2 # Checks out at solution 2
# And so on...
```
